## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Database Setup

Run the migration SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of ai-agents-migration.sql
```

This will create the `ai_agents` table with proper RLS policies.

### 2. Environment Variables

Add your API keys to `.env.local`:

```bash
VAPI_API_KEY=your_vapi_api_key_here
VAPI_API_URL=https://api.vapi.ai
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapi_public_key_here
```

### 3. Test the Feature

1. **Navigate to AI Agents**: Click "AI Agents" in the sidebar
2. **Create an Agent**: Click "Create New Agent" or the setup button
3. **Follow the Wizard**:
   - Step 1: Enter assistant name, business type, and language
   - Step 2: Choose tone, voice, and greeting message
   - Step 3: Review and create
4. **Test Your Agent**: Use the test page to verify functionality
5. **Manage Agents**: View, edit, or delete agents from the main listing

## 📊 Database Schema

```sql

    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    business_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    language TEXT NOT NULL,
    tone TEXT NOT NULL,
    voice_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    voice_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    greeting_message TEXT,
    vapi_assistant_id TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Vapi API key not configured"
**Solution**: Make sure `VAPI_API_KEY` is set in your `.env.local` file and restart the dev server.

### Issue: "Failed to create agent in database"
**Solution**: Ensure the database migration has been run and RLS policies are properly configured.

### Issue: Empty agents list
**Solution**: Check that you're logged in and have completed onboarding. Create your first agent using the setup wizard.

### Issue: Voice samples not playing
**Solution**: This is expected - the play button is a placeholder. Actual voice samples would require additional Vapi API integration for previews.
